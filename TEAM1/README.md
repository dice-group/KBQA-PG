# Implementation Notes

All libraries you import from and which are not part of the standard python library have to be listed in 
`<path_to_github_repository>/TEAM1/requirements.txt`.

# Installation

Clone the repository `https://github.com/dice-group/KBQA-PG.git` or download it. Install required libraries with 
`pip install -r <path_to_github_repository>/TEAM1/requirements.txt`. To prevent a mess on your system use a conda environment.
