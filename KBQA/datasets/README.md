## Content

### lc-quad, qald-8, qald-9

The respectively named datasets. They also contain updated versions, see
[here](#insights-from-dataset-updating-using-quant) for information on the update.
We also note some information on the difference between qald-8 and -9 at [Comparison of QALD 8 and 9](#comparison-of-qald-8-and-9).

### qald-8-9-merged

Duplicate free merge of updated versions of qald-8 and qald-9 with the intent to test on qald-9-test after training
with the merged dataset.

### qtq

qtq (question-triple-query) datasets. Given a dataset with questions and queries (SPARQLs) e.g. qald-9, we generate
triples with one of our [summarizers](../appB/summarizers/README.md) in `KBQA/appB/summarizers`. These triples are
added to the datasets. These new kind of dataset we name qtq-datasets.

### preprocessed

Preprocessors of the App B models often take time. Here we store the preprocessed datasets. For more information, see
[/preprocessed](preprocessed/README.md).

## Insights from dataset updating using QUANT:

Object or property not existent (What are the official languages of the Philippines?)
Entity of list does not match with dbpedia page (Which movies starring Brad Pitt were directed by Guy Ritchie?)
Property is not specific (number instead of name) (Give me the grandchildren of Bruce Lee.)
Wikipage / Company was renamed. Maybe redirect? (Who is the owner of Universal Studios?)
Sparql incomplete (Which state of the United States of America has the highest density?)
Incomplete answer list / dbpeadia knowledge is missing (Give me a list of all trumpet players that were bandleaders.)  
Answer type is wrong (When was the Statue of Liberty built?)  
Language (@en) oder type tag (@int) is added (Who is the governor of Wyoming?)  
Fixed dates in SPARQL instead of relative (Give me all world heritage sites designated within the past two years.)  
Old SPARQL format used e.g. filtering (Give me all actors who were born in Paris after 1950.)  
Property is missing for some pages (What is the highest mountain?)
