# Webservices

Our QA-system implements different approaches and offers different services to evaluate the implementation of the approaches.

## Debug a service

To debug and run a webservice locally set the `FLASK_APP` environment variable to the name of the service (the starting python file) and use `flask run`:

```
$env:FLASK_APP = "gerbil"   # Windows
export FLASK_APP = gerbil   # Linux
flask run
```
